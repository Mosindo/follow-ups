# test_upswing_engineering

## intro
This project is a customer follow-up, with the possibility to add, delete or modify a customer.


## React / Express / MongoDB
I created a `run.sh` script that runs the project directly.

If you want to run it manually: 

Start backend : `cd backend`+`npm install` +`node initDbs`+ `nodemon index`


Start frontend: `cd frontend` + `npm start`
